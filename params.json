  "body": "This document briefly describes the code that implement the REL and the boosting-type greedy algorithm in my paper [\"Econometric Estimation with High-Dimensional Moment Equalities\"](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2491102) via a demonstration with the Chinese trade data.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Prerequisite\r\nTo run the code, we need to install [**MOSEK**](https://www.mosek.com/) and hook it up with Matlab. **MOSEK** is a commercial convex problem solver. It provides free academic license.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Data and Files\r\n\r\n* **trade_data.mat**: data file for the Chinese empirical application in my paper.\r\n* **master_REL.m**: the master function for the relaxed empirical likelihood.\r\n* **master_boosting:m**: the master function for the boosting procedure in my paper.\r\n* **EKK**: generates the predicted market entry and the sale. It contains the EKK paper's micro model as a nested function.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\nThe master files work on the author's PC in Matlab 2014b\r\n",
